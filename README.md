This project is all about accuratly driving brushless motors, for cheap.

The aim is to make it possible to use inexpensive brushless motors in high performance robotics projects.
Currently I am designing the next version of the PCB, which will include drive capability of two motors, and coordinated motion control. 
Contact me if you are interested in either alpha or beta testing.
