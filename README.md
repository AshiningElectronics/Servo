# Servo
This project is all about accuratly driving brushless motors, for cheap. The aim is to make it possible to use inexpensive brushless motors in high performance robotics projects.

The progress on version 3 of the controller is tracked on the [hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/11583-odrive-high-performance-motor-control) project page.

This repository is sort of a dumping ground for all the other aspects of the project, and for keeping the old stuff, and is not really active any more. Instead, refer to these repositories:
